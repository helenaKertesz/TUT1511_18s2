<h4>Printing a 2D field</h4>
<p>
When printing out something in 2D, most of the time you should be able
to use two nested <code>while</code> loops with an <code>if</code> inside.
This is generally considered easy to read

<pre><code>
int row = 0;
int col = 0;

// prints out the row (inner while) row_num times
while( row < row_num ){
   col = 0;

   // prints out one row by calling a printf col_num times
   while( col < col_num ){
      if( /* something using col and row*/ ){
         printf("*");
      } else {
         printf(" ");
      }
      col = col + 1;
   }   
   printf("\n");

   row = row + 1;
}
</pre></code>

Simply change what is inside the <code>if</code> to change what shape is printed.
If this statement is too long, consider putting it in a function.

Note this doesn't work as well if you are not printing out something made of
only 2 or 3 characters.
