<h4>#defines</h4>
<p>
A <code>#define</code> is used to define constants, rather than having "magic numbers" in the code. For example:
<code>#define NUM_CATS 4</code> then every time the compiler sees <code>NUM_CATS</code> it will replace it with <code>4</code
</p>
<p>
In the example below we run into a problem. This can be seen by looking at what <code>AVERAGE</code> gets evaluated as by replacing it bit by bit:
<pre><code class="nohighlight">AVERAGE
TOTAL / 2
FIRST_NUMBER + SECOND_NUMBER / 2
10 + 20 / 2 
This mathematically equals 20!
</pre></code>

We can do <code>#define TOTAL (FIRST_NUMBER + SECOND_NUMBER)</code> to prevent this
